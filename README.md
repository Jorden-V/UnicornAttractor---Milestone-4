# Solutions iO

The purpose of this project was to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
I set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the ability to pay to upvote features.


Deployed project below:

## UX

The website was designed for users of the fictional 'Unicorn Attractor' site to submit bugs, feature requests and general discussion posts
as well as to view statistics on how we handle these requests. On the homepage I have immediately provided links for users to navigate around the
site for ease of use. Users are able to navigate the site and view the resources without being registered however need to sign up to be able to
submit any bugs, feature requests or forum posts.

## User stories

1. A user notices a bug on the Unicorn Attractor website and wants to submit it to be fixed.
2. A user believes a certain feature would be a good addition to the Unicorn Attractor site and wants to submit that feature request.
3. A user is interested in how many bugs/feature requests are being submitted via our site.
4. A user notices a bug and wants to check if this has already been submitted (via the search function).
5. A has an idea for a feature however wants to check if something the same or similar has already been requested (via the search function).
6. A user wants a general discussion with fellow users therefore visits our forum section.

## Wireframes


1. [Homepage - Desktop wireframe](https://ibb.co/wKc62KR)

- Initially on the homepage I planned to display features and bugs however opted to move these to their own page.

2. [Homepage - Mobile wireframe](https://ibb.co/vqgcTj5)

- Mobile view is the same as desktop view.

3. [Base template - Desktop & Mobile wireframe(no difference other than Navbar collapsable)](https://ibb.co/qjHMfYD)

- I planned to display a Navbar and Footer in my base.html with the option to view/hide elements depending on if the user was logged in or not.
- Since then i decided to show all to non registered users but restricted their ability to interact throughout the site.

4. [Bugs, Features and Forum post - Desktop Wireframe](https://ibb.co/n1kc2wP)

- This remained similar to my original wireframe with the exception of displaying the items in rows instead of blocks. I also opted to add the image headers on each page.

5. [Bugs, Features and Forum post - Mobile Wireframe](https://ibb.co/PMbxhjn)

- Again this remained similar to the original wireframe.

6. [Bugs, Features and Forum post detail - Desktop Wireframe](https://ibb.co/1zZxJQJ)

- No major changes from the original wireframe here.

7. [Bugs, Features and Forum post detail - Mobile Wireframe](https://ibb.co/SfdyScd)

- No major changes from the original wireframe here.

8. [Graphs - Desktop Wireframe](https://ibb.co/sb5xjd2)

- No major changes from the original wireframe here.

9. [Graphs - Mobile Wireframe](https://ibb.co/Csf3117)

- No major changes from the original wireframe here.

## Automated tests
### Validation services
- I used [This HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure my code was legal.
- I used [This CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure my CSS was legal.
- I used [This Python validator](http://pep8online.com/) to ensure my Python was legal.
    - I also used [autopep](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) to format my python code systematically.
- I used a number of automated tests which can be found in the test.py files in each applications folders.

### Stripe payment testing
Please use the below information to test payments.
- Card number - 4242424242424242
- CVC - 111
- Expiry date - Any date in the future.

Due to the below statement payments with be successful if a use provides a blank CVC. I have however added validation if a user was to enter an incorrect CVC.
By default, passing address or CVC data with the card number causes the address and CVC checks to succeed. If this information isn't specified, the value of the checks is null. Any expiration date in the future is considered valid.
You can also provide invalid card details to test specific error codes resulting from incorrect information being provided. For example:
invalid_expiry_month: Use an invalid month (e.g., 13)
invalid_expiry_year: Use a year in the past (e.g., 1970)
invalid_cvc: Use a two digit number (e.g., 99).

## Manual tests

- Bugs, Features and Posts applications
1. If comment form is valid, comment displays in detailed view and also increments comment count by 1 so i am able to display how many comments each item has.
2. User is only able to upvote the same item once, if user attempts to upvote a second time an error message is displayed.
3. Added @login_required across the site to ensure only registered users can submit etc.
4. Updated views to validate if the user who created the bug is the same one viewing it. This is to ensure only the creator can edit/delete those items.
 
- Accounts application

1. If a contact form is submitted, the information is emailed to myself as well as redirecting the user to the index page and displaying a confirmation message.
2. A confirmation message is displayed when a user logs in or out.
3. Error message is displayed correctly if user inputs incorrect details at login.
4. Correct error messages display if user is attempting to register with existing details, also success message appears on successful registration.

- Cart application

1. A user can only add 1 unique feature to their cart at a time, error message is displayed if same feature is already in basket.
2. Deleting an item removes it from the cart.

- Checkout application

1. Check that customer data form validates correctly.
2. Check that customer payment form validates correctly.
3. Display error messages for incorrect payment details.
