# Solutions iO

The purpose of this project was to create a website that users can store and easily access cooking recipes.

The purpose of this project was to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
I set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the ability to pay to upvote features.


Deployed project below:

## UX

The website was designed for users of the fictional 'Unicorn Attractor' site to submit bugs, feature requests and general discussion posts
as well as to view statistics on how we handle these requests. On the homepage I have immediately provided links for users to navigate around the
site for ease of use. Users are able to navigate the site and view the resources without being registered however need to sign up to be able to
submit any bugs, feature requests or forum posts.

### User stories

- A user notices a bug on the Unicorn Attractor website and wants to submit it to be fixed.
- A user believes a certain feature would be a good addition to the Unicorn Attractor site and wants to submit that feature request.
- A user is interested in how many bugs/feature requests are being submited via our site.
- A user notices a bug and wants to check if this has already been submitted (via the search function).
- A has an idea for a feature however wants to check if something the same or similar has already been requested (via the search function).
- A user wants a general discussion with fellow users therefore visists our forum section.

## Wireframes


1. [Homepage - Desktop wireframe]()

- Initially on the homepage I planned to display features and bugs however opted to move these to their own page.

2. [Homepage - Mobile wireframe]()

- Mobile view is the same as desktop view.

3. [Base template - Desktop & Mobile wireframe(no difference other than navbar collapsable)]()

- I planned to display a Navbar and Footer in my base.html with the option to view/hide elements depending on if the user was logged in or not.
- Since then i decided to show all to non registred users but restricted their ability to interact throughout the site.

4. [Bugs, Features and Forum post - Desktop Wireframe]()

- This remained similar to my origial wireframe with the exception of displaying the items in rows instead of blocks. I also opted to add the image headers on each page.

5. [Bugs, Features and Forum post - Mobile Wireframe]()

- Again this remained similar to the original wireframe.

6. [Bugs, Features and Forum post detail - Desktop & Mobile Wireframe]()

- No major changes from the original wireframe here.

- I used [This CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure my CSS was legal.
- I used [This Python validator](http://pep8online.com/) to ensure my Python was legal.

- I used a number of automated tests in conjunction with coverage and manually tested the areas not covered. Below I have documented the manual tests.

- Bugs, Features and Posts applications
1. If comment form is valid, comment displays in detailed view and also increments comment count by 1 so i am able to display how many comments each item has.
2. User is only able to upvote the same item once, if user attempts to upvote a second time an error message is displayed.

    1. Displays as intended

## Deployment

1. New Heroku Python App created.
2. Launched Heroku in the C9 environment.
3. Initiate new Git repository and run git remote add Heroku https://git.heroku.com/recipe-milestone-project.git to allow a push to the Heroku server.
4. To prevent a "push fail", the requirements.txt was updated using the following command sudo pip3 freeze --local >requirements.txt to keep track of dependancies.
5. A Procfile was created using the following code: echo web: python run.py > Procfile to inform Heroku which file to run for initiating the app.
6. To ensure that Web Processes are running the following command line was run in C9: Heroku ps:scale web=1.
7. Config Vars set as follows: IP=0.0.0.0 and PORT=5000.
8. Lastly, dynos were restarted in Heroku app.
9. Code added, committed and pushed to both GitHub and Heroku.
10. App launched successfully.
11. In addition, you can clone or download the code from this GitHub repository.
